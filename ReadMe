Pupil Detection and Tracking

To run:
python main.py

Parameters:
Path to a video file: --filepath data/video/video.mp4
Define threshold for pupil tracking: --pupilthresh 100
Use live camera: --camera

--

For ball tracking:
Program relies on the color of the ball
To find the proper settings, run color_picker.py on a screenshot from the video
Then put the measure min and max into ball_tracking.py

For distance measurement:
Take a reference photo: ref_ball.jpg
And put the measured distance from camera to object into distance.py

--

Tests:
For g_train2.mp4 use ref_ball.JPG for reference and run:
python main.py --filepath data\video\g_train2.mp4 --pupilthresh 40

TODO:
in fit_circle only feed the eye part to make sure the circle fits into the eye -> then just use the circle as the pupil
