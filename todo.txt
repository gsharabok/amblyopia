Only track the closest ball (if ball behind face ignore it)
There is negative ball to face distance at the end
When moving the ball, hands cover the face, need a different way
Add a feature to detect when eye move far out at the end (eg give up and cannot see)

Detect when left eye/right eye distance flattens out and look for jumps (from graph data)

Measure performance over a few videos (how many frames out of total can correctly detect face/eye/pupil/ball %)
